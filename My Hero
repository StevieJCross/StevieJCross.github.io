What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says 
a lot about who we are as people.

The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics:

Humility
Strength
Nurturing
Conviction

My hero is my dad!  I look up to him and everything he is about.  He is the hardest worker I know.  He runs our family construction business
but his priority is his family.  He takes care of us unconditionally.  He has the biggest heart and will help out our friends and family
whenever needed.
