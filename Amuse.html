		<h1>Amusing</h1>
		<h3>by Steven Cross</h3>

		<p>The internet has some funny websites.  This page contains things that I think are hilarious.</p>

		<h2>First Laugh</h2>
    		<p>One funny website I like is called The Oatmeal. It has funny meme's for a variety of subjects. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  See the link below to take you right there.</p>

    		<h2>Second Laugh</h2>
   		 <p>YouTube is a great source to get new laughs from. However, remember everything goes on YouTube.</p>
