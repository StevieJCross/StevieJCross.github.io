        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		Sydney is someone I look up to!  Being a track athlete myself who also runs hurdles, she has inspired me to keep chasing my dreams.
